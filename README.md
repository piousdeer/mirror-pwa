# Mirror

A mirror progressive web app. Can flip the image horizontally. Simple, tiny, thoroughly commented, can be used for learning and/or as a sample PWA, can be hosted on any static HTTPS server.

If you need to automatically generate bitmap icons from SVGs, have Inkscape installed, cd into `icons` and run `render.sh`.
